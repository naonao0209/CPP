Abstract base class Engine contains engine type, cylinder and horsepower as integer data members 
Virtual functions showEngineType() and showCylinders() and showHP()   
Concrete class Car inherited from Engine that has make, model and year 
Concrete class Bike inherited from Engine that has make, and engine volume 
Concrete class Plane inherited from Engine that has numberOfEngines and liftload 
Class Plane must have an operator =, ==, !=, and + implemented in it.
 Functionality of =, ==, and != is obvious, the functionality of + operator should be generating a plane 
with the addition of the liftloads of the two added planes. 
 
1. Create a C ++ hierarchy of classes considering all items as well as the followings: (80 marks) 
 
Main program is required to demonstrate the functionality of your classes
Virtual functions should be overloaded in all concrete classes to show
 showEngineType, showHP()  and showCylinders()
Exception handling should be implemented in driver program for constructing objects 
to catch negative number of cylinders, negative horse power.(20 Marks)
